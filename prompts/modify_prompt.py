# To fulfill this task, follow these steps:

# 1. **Decompose the Query**:
#     - Break down the query into its key components to understand what information or action is being requested.

# 2. **Determine if Tools Should be Applied**:
#     - Identify if any tools from the provided list can be used to address parts or all of the query.
#     - For each key component of the query, match it against the 'func_name' and 'docstring' of the tools to find the most relevant one(s).

# 3. **Check if Response Satisfies the Query**:
#     - Apply the identified tool(s) to generate a response.
#     - Evaluate the response to see if it fully addresses the query.
#     - If the response does not satisfy the query, go back to step 2 to reconsider the tool(s) or their application.

# 4. **Provide the Response**:
#     - Once the response is satisfactory, compile the final answer and provide it to the user.
